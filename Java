Java is an object-oriented programming language widely used in enterprise applications,
Android development, and backend systems. Understanding Java fundamentals is crucial
for acing interviews and building a strong programming foundation.

--------------------------------------------------

1. Is Java Platform Independent? If yes, how?

Yes, Java is a platform-independent language.

Java source code is compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class file).
This bytecode is not specific to any operating system or hardware.

The bytecode runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Although JVM is platform dependent, the bytecode is the same for all platforms.
This allows Java programs to run anywhere a compatible JVM is available.

This concept is known as:
"Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)"

--------------------------------------------------

2. What is a JVM?

JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

It is responsible for:
- Loading bytecode
- Verifying bytecode
- Executing bytecode

JVM is platform dependent, meaning different JVM implementations exist
for different operating systems.

JVM plays a key role in making Java platform independent.

--------------------------------------------------

3. What is JIT?

JIT stands for Just-In-Time Compiler.

It is a part of the JRE and improves Java performance at runtime.

Working process:
- Source code is compiled by javac into bytecode
- Bytecode is passed to the JVM
- JIT compiles frequently used bytecode into native machine code
- JVM directly executes native code instead of interpreting bytecode

This increases execution speed and performance.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
- Part of JRE
- Converts bytecode into machine code
- Platform dependent

JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
- Provides an environment to run Java programs
- Contains JVM and core libraries

JDK (Java Development Kit):
- Used to develop and run Java programs
- Contains development tools and JRE

--------------------------------------------------

5. What are Memory Storages available with JVM?

JVM memory areas:

Class (Method) Area:
- Stores class-level data
- Stores runtime constant pool, methods, fields

Heap:
- Stores objects
- Memory allocated at runtime

Stack:
- Stores method calls, local variables
- Used during method execution

Program Counter Register:
- Stores address of currently executing instruction

Native Method Stack:
- Stores native method information

--------------------------------------------------

6. What is Class Loader?

Class Loader is a part of JVM responsible for loading classes into memory at runtime.

Responsibilities:
- Loading: Loads .class files
- Linking: Verifies bytecode and prepares static variables
- Initialization: Executes static blocks and initializes static data

--------------------------------------------------

7. Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java

public:
- Makes the method accessible to JVM from anywhere

static:
- Allows JVM to call the method without creating an object

void:
- Method does not return any value

main:
- Entry point of Java program

String args[]:
- Stores command-line arguments

--------------------------------------------------

8. What will happen if we don’t declare the main method as static?

If main is not static:
- Code compiles successfully
- Runtime error occurs

Error example:
"Main method is not static in class Example"

Reason:
JVM cannot call a non-static method without creating an object.

--------------------------------------------------

9. What are Packages in Java?

Packages are a group of related classes and interfaces.

They provide:
- Namespace management
- Access protection

--------------------------------------------------

10. Why are Packages used?

Packages are used to:
- Avoid naming conflicts
- Control access
- Organize code
- Improve maintainability

--------------------------------------------------

11. Advantages of Packages in Java

- Prevents class name conflicts
- Supports access control
- Helps hide internal classes
- Makes code easier to locate and manage

--------------------------------------------------

12. Types of Packages in Java

Two types of packages:
- User-defined packages
- Built-in packages

--------------------------------------------------

13. Why is Java not 100% Object-Oriented?

Java is not fully object-oriented because it supports
primitive data types like:
- int
- char
- boolean
- double

Primitive types are not objects.

--------------------------------------------------

14. What is the use of System.out.println()?

Used to print output to the console.

System:
- Predefined class

out:
- Static PrintStream object

println():
- Method used to print message

--------------------------------------------------

15. What are Comments in Java?

Comments are used to explain code.
They are ignored by the compiler.

Types of comments:

Single-line comment:
//

Multi-line comment:
/* comment */

Documentation comment:
/** comment */
